## Plugins
The following is a list of plugins that can be integrated into this package:

## Routing
Each page may have a property named `subPages`. The router generator creates the routing hierarchy by generating a page component for each subPage and adding it to the router hierarchy. It uses name or ref for router name. The path is the specified path property or, if doesn't exist, the name property.
